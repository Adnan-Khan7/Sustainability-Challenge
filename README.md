## Problem Statement
More than 26 million tons of CO2 per year arises from fossil fuel used in "Motor vehicle productionâ€œ globally. The goal of this project is to track efficiently the CO<sub>2</sub> Emissions from cars and in turn provide a solution to reduce air pollution in UAE and make it among the cleanest countries in the world. This can be done by creating demand for public transport, and improving the system further using state-of-the-art technologies such as Blockchain, IoT & Artificial Intelligence.

## Target Beneficiers

Our Smart Public Transportation system will not only help by improving the air quality we breathe, increasing net development and environmental benefits but also help to mitigate the harmful effects of climate change on humans, plant and wildlife.

## Proposed Solution
To help people make an eco friendly choice we propose a solution where we incentivize and improve the public transportation system using state-of-the-art technologies in AI and Blockchain. Studies show that stringent vehicle regulations successfully provide air quality benefits. Our Smart Public Transportation System leverages the current license plate detection technology and combine it with the blockchain to levy tax on the fuel based cars in order to promote the use of Zero Emission Vehicles and public transport. This will improve the air quality in UAE as observed in other countries. The tax generated from the system can be used in multiple applications to further enhance the customer experience.

## Solution Architecture

Our solution comprises of four important modules:
1. The first being the Automatic Number Plate Recognition or the ANPR technology. This processes the video frames captured by the ANPR cameras mounted on the roads and processes the frames to correctly detect the license plates and send it to the second module which is the Blockchain in real time. 
2. The detected license plates will be stored in the Blockchain and the pollution amount will be calculated daily. If pollution amount exceeds predefined threshold, certain regulations may take place such as taxing fuel-based vehicles.
3. The tax generated will be used to provide incentives and encourage people for taking the public transport through a smartphone application.
4. Lastly, obtaining commuter's location data we can use AI algorithms to smartly optimize the travel route in real time.

## Financial Analysis
The estimated numbers in the business model of our product shows a booming revenue. The average number of fuel-based cars that enter Dubai on daily basis is more than three hundred twenty thousand cars.By taxing only 0.5$ per fuel-based vehicle and after deducting the development and maintenance costs, the system is capable of generating approximately 57.5 /year million dollars only in Dubai. This amount can be used by govt. to encourage moving towards green energy and enhance the customer experience.

## High Level Execution Roadmap

The project is divided into the following five phases.
Phase 1 and Phase 2 are successfully completed. Prototype development (Phase 3) is 50% completed.
