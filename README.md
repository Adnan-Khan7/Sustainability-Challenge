## Problem Statement
More than 26 million tons of CO2 per year arises from fossil fuel used in "Motor vehicle productionâ€œ globally. The goal of this project is to track efficiently the CO<sub>2</sub> Emissions from cars and in turn provide a solution to reduce air pollution in UAE and make it among the cleanest countries in the world. This can be done by creating demand for public transport, and improving the system further using state-of-the-art technologies such as Blockchain, IoT & Artificial Intelligence.

## Target Beneficiers

Our Smart Public Transportation system will help by Improving the air quality we breathe, increasing net development and environmental benefits, along with mitigating climate change.

## Operating Model & Ecosystem Partners
## Financial Analysis
The estimated numbers in the business model of our product shows a booming revenue. The average number of fuel-based cars that enter Dubai on daily basis is more than three hundred twenty thousand cars.By taxing only 0.5$ per fuel-based vehicle and after deducting the development and maintenance costs, the system is capable of generating approximately 57.5 million dollars only in Dubai. This amount can be used by govt. to give loans to people for buying electric vehicles and move towards using green energy.
